Installation of ROOT on Windows 10 Version 1709 (OS Build 16299.125) for some reasons the OS build seemed to be important.

============================================
Enabling Developer Mode & WSL on Windows 10
============================================

1. Go to Search for Settings
2. Under Settings -> Update and Security -> For Developers -> Select "Developer Mode"
3. Under Control Panel -> Programs -> Programs and Features -> Check "Windows Subsystem for Linux"

============================================
Downloading Ubuntu App from Microsoft Store
============================================

1. Go to Microsoft Store
2. Search for the (free) Ubuntu app. Check the version of Ubuntu. It was v16.04 as of 21/12/17.
3. Download it and install.

========================================
Downloading Prerequisites for CERN ROOT
========================================

1. Google "Prerequisites for ROOT CERN". You should be directed to https://root.cern.ch/build-prerequisites
2. Search for the relevant version of Linux installed. Mine was Ubuntu 16.04.
3. Copy and paste the command for Required Packages:   sudo apt-get install git dpkg-dev cmake g++ gcc binutils libx11-dev libxpm-dev \
                                                       libxft-dev libxext-dev
4. For my installation, there was an error message and the terminal suggested the command: sudo apt-get update
    This line gets the apt-get manager to get the required updates.
    After the update, enter: sudo apt-get upgrade
5. Once the relevant upgrades have been done, install them again using: sudo apt-get install git dpkg-dev cmake g++ gcc binutils libx11-dev libxpm-dev \
                                                                        libxft-dev libxext-dev
6. Copy and paste the command for Optional Packages: sudo apt-get install gfortran libssl-dev libpcre3-dev \
                                                     xlibmesa-glu-dev libglew1.5-dev libftgl-dev \
                                                     libmysqlclient-dev libfftw3-dev libcfitsio-dev \
                                                     graphviz-dev libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev \
                                                     libldap2-dev python-dev libxml2-dev libkrb5-dev \
                                                     libgsl0-dev libqt4-dev
7. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the optional packages if required.

==================
Download CERN ROOT
==================

1. Go to https://root.cern.ch/downloading-root
2. Check out the latest Pro(duction) version of ROOT since it should be the most stable.
3. Download the .tar file into local terminal (remember where you downloaded it)
4. Untar the file from the Ubuntu terminal installed above.
    a. Start the Ubuntu terminal
    b. cd to the folder where the .tar file was downloaded. For me, it was cd /mnt/c/.../hanweiz/
    c. Untar the file with: tar -xvf root6.(blah blah).tar
    d. If the above is done successfully, there should be a "root" directory created.
5. cd to /hanweiz/root/bin
6. enter command: ./thisroot.sh

===============
Xserver for GUI
===============

1. This step is optional and is required only if graphics is to be desired while using ROOT.
2. Search for an xserver for Windows. Xming and VcXsrv are ok, but VcXsrv was known to clash when multiple windows are opened from Ubuntu.
3. Download Xming instead.
4. If TBrowser function is required, remember to start XLaunch first.

==============================================
To change the default startup setting for bash
==============================================

1. cd ~ (this will bring us back to the home directory)
2. vim ~/.bashrc (this starts up vim. We scroll to the very bottom to type in the command we want to run upon startup.)
3. After every change, remmeber to do a: source ~/.bashrc to 'install' the new bashrc file.
